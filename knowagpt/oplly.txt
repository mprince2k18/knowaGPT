Founded in September 2020, Oplly’s mission is to establish the world’s first website that allows fans to request personal video messages from their icons. It provides a platform for people to discover and request originally created videos from celebrities of all kind and share those videos with friends and family. A central aspect of Oplly's mission is to give back to the community. Therefore, a part of the video fee is donated to a good cause that both the fan and celebrity share. Some of the world’s best established charities are working with Oplly in trying to make the world a better place. It is core to Oplly`s vision and values.
